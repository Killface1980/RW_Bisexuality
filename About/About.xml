Adds bisexuality to RimWorld. Bisexual pawns have no preference and can choose both genders as partner. 
Also modifies the opinion and attraction of ugly people towards each other so that they show more empathy. 
No more outcasts among outcasts. 

After the Psychology mod also added bisexuality, this mod's main feature is the mood offset for ugly people towards each other. Just load this mod after Psychology.
