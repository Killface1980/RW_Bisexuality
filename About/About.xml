Adds bisexuality to RimWorld. Bisexual pawns have no preference and can choose both genders as partner.
Also modifies the opinion and attraction of ugly people towards each other so that they show more empathy.
No more outcasts among outcasts.

Only new pawns spawned can be bisexual. If you choose to remove this mod from a current game, remove the following lines from your savegame:

&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;def&gt;Gay&lt;/def&gt;
  &lt;degree&gt;1&lt;/degree&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Removing only the line &lt;degree&gt;1&lt;/degree&gt; will change he bisexual trait to gay.
