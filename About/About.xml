Modifies the opinion and attraction of:
    - ugly pawns
    - creepy breathing pawns
    - annoying voice pawns
    - disfigured pawns
towards each other so that they show more empathy.
No outcasts among outcasts.

Also deaf / blind pawns are not botherered by certain traits.

Also adds bisexuality to RimWorld. Bisexual pawns have no preference and can choose both genders as partner.
After the Psychology mod also added bisexuality, this mod's main feature is the mood offset for socially not accepted pawns towards each other. Just load this mod after Psychology.
